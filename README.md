## ✨ Inspiration
This code was heavily inspired by [@jacc's music-box](https://github.com/jacc/music-box).

## 🎒 Prep Work
1. Create a new public GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com/)
1. Create a token with the `gist` scope and copy it. (https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
1. Create a Trakt.tv Application (https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new)
1. Copy the `API token`

## 🖥 Project Setup
1. Fork this repo
2. Go to your fork's `Settings` > `Secrets` > `Add a new secret` for each environment secret (below)

## 🤫 Environment Secrets
- **GIST_ID:** The ID portion from your gist url `https://gist.github.com/<github username>/`**`<gist ID>`**.
- **GH_TOKEN:** The GitHub token generated above.
- **TRAKT_ID:** The Client ID you got from creating a Trakt.tv app.
- **TRAKT_USERNAME:** Your Last.fm username.
- **MOVIE_BOX_MODE:** Select the box mode from three options.

## 🕵🏾 Hacking suggestions

  - You can set up CI on Travis if you want to modify this Github Action. You just have to configure the environment secrets as environment variables on travis. A build will be triggered on every push for the `develop` branch. Careful, your gist will be updated.
  - You can also test the script locally with Lando and Docker.
